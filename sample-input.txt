? Test instructions: 
**Q**: I want to prevent robots from indexing my custom error pages by setting the robots meta tag in the HTML head to "noindex". **A:** There is no need to. **Customerror** returns the correct HTTP status codes (403 and 404). This will prevent robots from indexing the error pages. **Q**: I want to customize the custom error template output. **A:** In your theme template folder for your site, copy the template provided by the **Customerror** module (i.e. `templates/customerror.html.twig`) and then make your modifications there.
