    license: 'GNU GPL v3',
    licenseBadge: `[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)`,
    copyright:
    `Copyright Â© 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, 
    but changing it is not allowed.
    
    Preamble
    The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds 
    of works.
    The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your 
    freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is 
    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make 
    sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the 
    GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work 
    released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public 
    Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free 
    software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if 
    you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and 
    that you know you can do these things.
    To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking 
    you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute 
    copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of 
    others.
    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you 
    must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure 
    that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so 
    they know their rights.
    Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright 
    on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, 
    distribute and/or modify it.
    For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no 
    warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that 
    modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed 
    erroneously to authors of previous versions.
    Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of 
    the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally 
    incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic 
    pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is 
    precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL 
    to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other 
    domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the 
    GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow 
    patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those 
    that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make 
    it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to 
    render the program non-free.
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.`
